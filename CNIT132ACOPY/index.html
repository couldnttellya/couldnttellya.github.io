        <p id="aboutMe">Hi! I'm Joe. I am a builder and an Artist. I love hiking, watching old movies and playing pickleball. 
            I am working on learing more about coding/technology with the idea that I may want to do a career
            change some day and having some skills to build from would be helpful in that. Please click around
            the links in the nav bar to check out some of the other things I've worked on.</p>
