        <p>A house is a structure designed for people to live in. It typically provides shelter, security, and a place for individuals or families to reside. Houses come in various shapes, sizes, and styles, ranging from single-family homes to apartments, condominiums, and more. <br><br>They usually contain rooms for sleeping, cooking, eating, and living, and often include amenities such as bathrooms, kitchens, and sometimes outdoor spaces like gardens or yards. Houses can be constructed from different materials such as wood, brick, concrete, or a combination of these, and can be customized to suit the needs and preferences of the occupants.</p>
