            <h2>Findings On User Engagement</h2>
            <p class="content">Over the past semester I've taken a deep dive into learning about Advanced HTML and CSS
                techniques. The following <a href="static/images/userEngagement.pdf" title="Final Project User Engagement
                Report From Januart First 2024 Through May 19th 2024">User Engagement Report</a> gives an overview of user 
                engagement of my project site for this course. This final analytics project investigates user engagement
                 using data visualization. The main takeaways I can conclude from this report are basically that site traffic
                 very directly correlated with marketing (posting homeworks on the forum) unless I manage proper use of 
                 SEO strategies. I saw a marked uptick in user traffic from the single time that I posted my homework to 
                 the online discussion board. Beyond that it appears that I there was very little traffic until I 
                 began work on the SEO strategies portion of this final homework project. The graph reveals that there was
                 a slight uptick in traffic beginning a few days ago from around the time I finished that first portion 
                 of this assignment. The main takeaway I have from this analysis is that with my current level of
                 engagement, the number one best way to drive traffic to my site would be through posting on forums to 
                 promote traffic. Further traffic could possibly be garnered through organic search with more work done 
                 on search engine optimization and with added high quality content in the form of images and backlinks.
