        <p id="aboutMe">Hi! I'm Joe. I am a builder and an Artist. I love hiking, watching old movies and playing pickleball. 
            I am working on learing more about coding/technology and I am particularly interested in learning more about performance 
            optimization. I am interested in the idea of changing careers into doing some kind of web development. Learning advanced 
            web development techniques will be helpful in that. Please click around the links in the nav bar to check out some 
            of the other things I've worked on.</p>
