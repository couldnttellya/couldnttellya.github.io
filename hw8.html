        <ol class="answers">
                    <li>XQuery is used to search XML documents for elements and atributes.<sup>1</sup>
                        It's main function is to allow a programmer to extract specific data. 
                        It's benifit is in its high level ease of use and versitility/power in extracting data.
                        XQuery can also be used to transform XML into XHTML.<sup>2</sup>
                        It has a broad range of application in web service and for use in summary reports.

                        When hw8.xq is applied to hw8.xml it will select every book in bookstore where the price is less than 30 and return their titles. Breaking down the following code snippet:<br>
                        <div class="codeSnippet">
                            xquery version "1.0";<br><br>

                            for $b in<br>
                            &emsp;   doc("hw8.xml")/bookstore/book<br><br>

                            where <br>
                            &emsp;   $b/price &lt; 30<br><br>

                            return $b/title<br>
                        </div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The line "xquery version "1.0";" defines the xquery version being used</li>
                            <li>The line "for $b in" creates a variable "$b"</li>
                            <li>The line "doc("hw8.xml")/bookstore/book" looks in "hw8.xml" -> for each "bookstore" -> for each "book" and sets that array of returned elements into "$b"</li>
                            <li>The line "where $b/price &lt; 30" selects all the books stored in $b where the price attribute is less than 30</li>
                            <li>The line "return $b/title" returns the title attribute from all of the selected books in $b</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>What is XQIB?</h4>
                        XQIB stands for XQuery In the Browser.<sup>1</sup>
                        XQIB can be used with XQuery to perform client side XQuery operations in a browser just like you would with javascript<sup>3</sup>
                        To do so one one only needs to include a the script:<sup>3</sup> <div class="codeSnippet">"&lt;script type="text/javascript"src="path/to/mxqueryjs/mxqueryjs.nocache.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;"</div>
                        This could be very useful if one wanted to build a lightweight web application to run entirely client side, reducing the need for server resources while retaining the power and versitility of using XML with XQuery.
